# Constitution of Project Synergio

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date Ratified:** 2026-02-14
**Last Amended:** 2026-02-14

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the non-negotiable rules, principles, and governance structures for the Synergio codebase. It serves as the supreme agreement for all automated agents and human contributors.

## 1. Fundamental Principles

### 1.1 Simplicity First
The implementation MUST strictly adhere to the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) philosophy.
*   **Rationale:** Simplicity produces reliable code. Over-engineering and unnecessary complexity are PROHIBITED. Focus on the simplest working solution.

### 1.2 Clean Code
All code MUST follow clean code principles.
*   **Structure:** Methods MUST be small and focused on a single task.
*   **Naming:** Variables and methods MUST have meaningful names that convey their purpose.
*   **Duplication:** Avoid code duplication by reusing existing methods/classes.
*   **Refactoring:** Long methods MUST be refactored into smaller components.
*   **Comments:** Comments are considered "dirty code" and are PROHIBITED, except for Javadoc. Code MUST be self-documenting.
*   **Constraint:** Do NOT modify existing code solely to "clean" it unless explicitly instructed.

### 1.3 Compliance
Compliance with this constitution and its incorporated policies is MANDATORY unless explicitly instructed otherwise by a human operator. The constitution itself MUST NOT be deleted.

## 2. Technical Constraints

### 2.1 Technology Stack
The project is strictly limited to the following stack:
*   **Framework:** Spring Boot Microservice
*   **Frontend:** Thymeleaf with JavaScript
*   **Persistence:** CSV files (NO databases allowed)
*   **Build Tool:** Gradle
*   **Language:** Java (OpenJDK 21.0.5 2024-10-15 LTS) unless otherwise specified.

### 2.2 Data Persistence
*   **Implementation:** All data MUST be persisted to CSV files.
*   **Prohibition:** Database usage is explicitly PROHIBITED.

### 2.3 Logging & Error Handling
*   **Before Exception:** An error MUST be logged with appropriate information before throwing an exception.
*   **Successful Execution:** An info log MUST be written with appropriate information upon successful method execution (especially for methods returning values).
*   **Exclusion:** Getters and setters are excluded from logging requirements.

### 2.4 Testing Methodology
*   **Constraint:** Test Driven Development (TDD) is expressly PROHIBITED.

## 3. Workflow & Process

### 3.1 Git Operations
All operations MUST comply with `git-policy.md`.
*   **Branch Creation:** PERMITTED.
*   **Code Pushing:** PROHIBITED unless explicitly permitted by the user following an `/implement` command.
*   **Merging:** PROHIBITED on protected branches (`main`, `develop`) without explicit user instruction.

### 3.2 Branch Naming Convention
All branches created by the Agent MUST strictly follow this structure (lowercase):
`<branch-type>/<scope-number>/<git-spec-branch-name>/<branch-description>`

*   **Active Configuration:**
    *   `branch-type`: feature
    *   `scope-number`: SCO-0001
    *   `git-spec-branch-name`: [Generated dynamically by /plan]
    *   `branch-description`: [Derived from /specify]

### 3.3 Requirement Tracking
*   **Completed Requirements:** MUST be marked with `Status: DONE` in `Requirements.md`.
*   **New/Pending Requirements:** MUST be marked with `Status: TO DO` in `Requirements.md`.

## 4. Governance

### 4.1 Amendment Process
Values and principles defined herein (specifically `branch-type` and `scope-number`) are updated via the `/speckit.constitution` command.

### 4.2 Commit Messages
*   **Standard:** Conventional Commits style.
*   **Content:** Messages MUST be clear, descriptive, and explain the purpose of the change.
