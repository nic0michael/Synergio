# Specification Quality Checklist: Generate New Requirements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-14
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) -- *Exception: User explicitly requested implementation of specific technical requirements defined in Requirements.md which contain class names/method signatures. I've kept class names to ensuring mapping, but focused capabilities.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification -- *See note above.*

## Notes

- The input `Requirements.md` contains strict technical implementation details (class names, method signatures). The `spec.md` reflects these as functional requirements to ensure compliance with the specific user request, while User Stories remain business-focused.
